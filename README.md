The OpenAI AI Agent template is a **MINIMAL** template to build an AI Agent that can be hosted on Phala Network's decentralized hosting protocol. Unlike Vercel or other FaaS, it allows you to publish your AI Agent compiled code to IPFS and hosts it on a fully decentralized FaaS cloud with the following benefits:

- üí® Ship Fast: Build and ship with familiar toolchain in minutes
- ‚õëÔ∏è Secure: Execution guarded by rock solid TEE / Intel SGX
- üîí Private: Host API keys and user privacy at ease
- üíé Unstoppable: Powered by IPFS and Phala's 35k+ decentralized TEE workers

## Getting Started
### Prepare
Install dependencies
```shell
npm install
```

### Testing Locally
Create `.env` file with the default ThirdWeb API key for publishing your Agent Contract to IPFS
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Build your Agent
```shell
npm run build
```

Test your Agent locally
```shell
npm run test
```

Expected Test Results
```shell
INPUT: {"method":"GET","path":"/ipfs/CID","queries":{"chatQuery":["When did humans land on the moon?"],"openAiModel":["gpt-4o"]},"secret":{"openaiApiKey":"YOUR_API_KEY"},"headers":{}}
GET RESULT: {
  status: 200,
  body: `{"message":"Humans first landed on the moon on July 20, 1969, during NASA's Apollo 11 mission. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin \\"Buzz\\" Aldrin became the first and second humans to walk on the lunar surface while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit aboard the Command Module. Neil Armstrong famously declared, \\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\\" as he stepped onto the moon."}`,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
  }
}
INPUT: {"method":"POST","path":"/ipfs/CID","queries":{"chatQuery":["When did humans land on the moon?"],"openAiModel":["gpt-4o"]},"secret":{"openaiApiKey":"YOUR_API_KEY"},"headers":{},"body":"{}"}
POST RESULT: {
  status: 200,
  body: '{"message":"Not Implemented"}',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
  }
}
Now you are ready to publish your agent, add secrets, and interact with your agent in the following steps:
- Execute: 'npm run publish-agent'
- Set secrets: 'npm run set-secrets'
- Go to the url produced by setting the secrets (e.g. https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/QmPQJD5zv3cYDRM25uGAVjLvXGNyQf9Vonz7rqkQB52Jae?key=b092532592cbd0cf)
```

### Publish Your AI Agent
Upload your compiled AI Agent code to IPFS.
```shell
npm run publish-agent
```

Upon a successful upload, the command should show the URL to access your AI Agent.
```shell
‚úì Compiled successfully.
  76.86 KB  dist/index.js
Running command: npx thirdweb upload dist/index.js
This may require you to log into thirdweb and will take some time to publish to IPFS...

‚úî Open this link to view your upload: https://b805a9b72767504353244e0422c2b5f9.ipfscdn.io/ipfs/bafybeig4up5mjx6kvkm5dizsv2njpkzk7pileis3kfheyd5wff2m3wbtrm/

Agent Contract deployed at: https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/QmdBwRk3YG78thoe9phf43CLAzShYUEiPHnWBu6bkqsJVY

If your agent requires secrets, ensure to do the following:
1) Edit the ./secrets/default.json file or create a new JSON file in the ./secrets folder and add your secrets to it.
2) Run command: 'npm run set-secrets' or 'npm run set-secrets [path-to-json-file]'
Logs folder created.
Deployment information updated in ./logs/latestDeployment.json
```

> :information_source: Note that your latest deployment information will be logged to in file [`./logs/latestDeployment.json`](./logs/latestDeployment.json). This file is updated every time you publish a new Agent Contract to IPFS. This file is also used to get the IPFS CID of your Agent Contract when setting secrets for your Agent Contract.
>
> Here is an example:
> ```json
> {
>   "date": "2024-08-29T20:28:20.081Z",
>   "cid": "QmYzBTdQNPewdhD9GdBJ9TdV7LVhrh9YVRiV8aBup7qZGu",
>   "url": "https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/QmYzBTdQNPewdhD9GdBJ9TdV7LVhrh9YVRiV8aBup7qZGu"
> }
> ```

> **Did Thirdweb fail to publish?**
>
> If ThirdWeb fails to publish, please signup for your own ThirdWeb account to publish your Agent Contract to IPFS. Signup or login at https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/
>
> Whenever you log into ThirdWeb, create a new API key and replace the default API Key with yours in the [.env](./.env) file.

> ```
> THIRDWEB_API_KEY="YOUR_THIRDWEB_API_KEY"
> ```

### Access the Published AI Agent

Once published, your AI Agent is available at the URL: `https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/<your-cid>`. You can get it from the "Publish to IPFS" step.

You can test it with `curl`.

```bash
curl https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/<your-cid>
```

### Add Secrets

By default, all the compiled JS code is visible for anyone to view if they look at IPFS CID. This makes private info like API keys, signer keys, etc. vulnerable to be stolen. To protect devs from leaking keys, we have added a field called `secret` in the `Request` object. It allows you to store secrets in a vault for your AI Agent to access.

To add your secrets,
1) Edit the [default.json](./secrets/default.json) file or create a new JSON file in the `./secrets` folder and add your secrets to it.
```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
}
```
2) Run command to set the secrets
```shell
npm run set-secrets
# or if you have a custom JSON file
npm run set-secrets <path-to-json-file>
```
Expected output:
```shell
Use default secrets...
Storing secrets...
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   205    0    68  100   137    105    213 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   319
{"token":"37a0f3f344a3bbf7","key":"343e2a7dc130fedf","succeed":true}

Secrets set successfully. Go to the URL below to interact with your agent:
https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/QmYzBTdQNPewdhD9GdBJ9TdV7LVhrh9YVRiV8aBup7qZGu?key=343e2a7dc130fedf
Log entry added to secrets.log
```

> :information_source: Note that all your secrets will be logged in file [`./logs/secrets.log`](./logs/secrets.log). This file is updated every time you add new secrets to your Agent Contract. If you have not published an Agent Contract, yet, this command will fail since there is not a CID to map the secrets to.
>
> Here is an example:
> ```text
> 2024-08-29T20:30:35.480Z, CID: [QmYzBTdQNPewdhD9GdBJ9TdV7LVhrh9YVRiV8aBup7qZGu], Token: [37a0f3f344a3bbf7], Key: [343e2a7dc130fedf], URL: [https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/QmYzBTdQNPewdhD9GdBJ9TdV7LVhrh9YVRiV8aBup7qZGu?key=343e2a7dc130fedf]
> ```

The API returns a `token` and a `key`. The `key` is the id of your secret. It can be used to specify which secret you are going to pass to your frame. The `token` can be used by the developer to access the raw secret. You should never leak the `token`.

To verify the secret, run the following command where `key` and `token` are replaced with the values from adding your `secret` to the vault.
```shell
curl https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/vaults/<key>/<token>
```

Expected output:
```shell
{"data":{"openaiApiKey":"<OPENAI_API_KEY>"},"succeed":true}
```

### Access Queries
To help create custom logic, we have an array variable named `queries` that can be accessed in the `Request` class. To access the `queries` array variable `chatQuery` value at index `0`, the syntax will look as follows:
```typescript
const query = req.queries.chatQuery[0] as string;
```
The example at https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/QmcQbQzJop8m9uqGJTRmxVCEPoWtzx6NkNJRA12CZ6vFyT?key=b7fd2b6c4bf008cc&chatQuery=When%20did%20humans%20land%20on%20the%20moon will have a value of `When did humans land on the moon`. `queries` can have any field name, so `chatQuery` is just an example of a field name and not a mandatory name, but remember to update your `index.ts` file logic to use your expected field name.
